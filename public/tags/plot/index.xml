      <description>Abstract While the annual TTC ridership has been maintaining stability in the past decade, the ridership of 2020 in the first two quarters shows an abnormal decline as a result of the social limitation during the pandemic. A scatterplot is employed to present the monthly ridership in the past 5 years with linear regression analysis to explore the trend. The huge decline in 2020 is presented in the bar chart to compare with the previous year.</description>
